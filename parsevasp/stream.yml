  message: "There is an error when creating the irreducible k-point grid, most likely the symmetry of the cell does not match the k-point sampling."
  suggestion: "Change the k-point layout, for instance make sure that if two lattice sides are of equal length, the k-point sampling along the same sides are the same. If that does not work, try to change the sampling rate and shift the grid out of Gamma, or in to Gamma."

  recover: False
